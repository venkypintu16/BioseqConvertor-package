## R project BioseqConvertor-Package. 

I have created this sequence conversion R package which can help Biology personnels when dealing with sequence analysis works.
BioSeqConvertor is an R package designed for the determination and conversion of biological sequences. 
This package provides functions to convert DNA sequences to RNA, RNA sequences to protein, and protein sequences to cDNA. 
I have created 3 functions like dna_to_rna which converts DNA sequence to RNA sequence which is called "Transcription" in Biology.
rna_to_protein is another function which converts RNA sequence to Protein sequence which is called "Translation" process in Biology.
The last function is protein_to_cdna which converts the protein sequence into DNA sequence.
I hope this package is useful for bioinformatics analysis and molecular biology research.

Moreover, you can find a summary for my package in my blog post. Here, is the link for my blog:
