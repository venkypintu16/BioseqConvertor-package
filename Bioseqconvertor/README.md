================

# BioSeqConvertor

## Overview

BioSeqConvertor is an R package designed for the determination and
conversion of biological sequences. This package provides functions to
convert DNA sequences to RNA, RNA sequences to protein, and protein
sequences to cDNA. This package is useful for bioinformatics analysis
and molecular biology research.

## Installation

You can install BioSeqConvertor from GitHub using the `devtools`
package:

`r devtools::install_github("your_username/BioSeqConvertor")`r

## Load the package
